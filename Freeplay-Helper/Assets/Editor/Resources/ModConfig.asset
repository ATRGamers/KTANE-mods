  title: Freeplay Timer and Module Helper
  description: "This service helps out for those large bomb cases that have been released
    recently, so that you don't have to keep clicking your mouse button over and over
    to max out the modules and/or time for the selected bomb case loaded.\r\n\r\nThe
    controls are as follows\r\nUp/Down arrow - Selects the desired freeplay option\r\nLeft/Right
    arrows - Sets the option.\r\nEnter - Starts the bomb.  (same as if you clicked
    the Start button)\r\n\r\nIf the freeplay case is currently not open, pressing
    any of those above keys will open the freeplay case, and the Timer option will
    be selected.\r\n\r\nFor as long as Left/Right is held while modules or time is
    selected, that option will increase/decrease continuously, starting slowly, but
    get faster till it reaches top speed, the longer you hold that key.  This is definitely
    faster than clicking your mouse button over and over to get to the desired high
    setting.\r\n\r\nCredits to at_bash for the freeplay reflection code from twitch-plays
    on which I based this on."
