  title: Vanilla Rule Modifier
  description: 'Ever wish you could change the rules you play the vanilla modules
    under?  This mod was inspired by LtHummus''s original Unofficial KTaNE manual
    hack.


    The Default seed for this mod is Seed #6502.


    Seed #1 is Vanilla.

    Seed #2 is the original LtHummus Hack.


    You can change this seed in the settings json.


    The API for this is as follows.


    GameObject gameObject = GameObject.Find("VanillaRuleModifierProperties");

    IDictionary<string, object> Properties = gameObject.GetComponent<IDictionary<string,
    object>>();


    Get the current rule seed with Properties["RuleSeed"].

    Set the rule seed with Properties["RuleSeed"] = seed.


    Lock in the rule seed with Properties["RuleSeed"] = new object[] {seed, true};  The
    rule seed is always readable, but can only be written to / saved during setup
    or post game.


    Generate the manual and get the Directory of the generated manual with Properties["GetRuleManual"].
    This property is read only, and can only be read during setup or post game.


    Find out if a given seed uses the original rule generator or modified rule generators
    with Propeties["IsSeedVanilla"] or Properties["IsSeedModded"].  These properties
    are read only.


    Seeds 1, 2 and everything less than or equal to -3 are vanilla seeds. The rest
    of them are modded seeds.'
