{"id":"AlarmClockExtender","title":"Alarm Clock Timer Extender","description":"With the ability to easily replace the alarm clock sound with custom effects, comes the desire to extend how long the alarm clock plays for.  This service does exactly that.  You can also specify a custom directory containing your entire music collection,  and this service will pick from those files to play.\r\n\r\n[h1]These are the confgurable settings.[/h1]\r\nAlarmClockBuzzerTime - The length of time to play the alarm clock for.  If the track/clip is shorter than this specififed time and it is not looped, it will play the entire clip, then shut off.  Otherwise, it will pick a random spot within that clip and play that length of time of the clip.   If you don't wish to load in your music collection, you can ignore the rest of the settings.\r\n\r\nSoundFileDirectory - Where you music collection resides.\r\n\r\nRescanDirectory - If set to true, your specified directory will be rescanned prior to the start of each bomb,  otherwise, it will only be scanned once.\r\n\r\nChanceOfNormalBeep - A number between 0 and 100, specifying the percert chance that the alarm clock will play the annoying beep instead of your loaded music.\r\n\r\n[h1]Supported File Formats[/h1]\r\nThese formats are supported.  \r\nStreaming formats: .MP3, .OGG, .WAV\r\nTracker formats:  .IT, .S3M, .XM, .MOD\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]To Sound pack makers[/h1]\r\nWhether you are making a sound pack either the traditional way through Unity, or with Samfun's Sound Pack maker,  if you wish to have a particular Alarm clock beep file to loop,  include \"[Looped]\" anywhere in the file name of that track.  If this mod finds that tag, it will Loop that clip.  (This also applies to anything that may be in your music collection.)\r\n","version":"1.0","unityVersion":"2017.4.20f2"}
