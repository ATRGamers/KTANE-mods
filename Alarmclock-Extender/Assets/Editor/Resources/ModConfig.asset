  title: Alarm Clock Timer Extender
  description: "With the ability to easily replace the alarm clock sound with custom
    effects, comes the desire to extend how long the alarm clock plays for.  This
    service does exactly that.  You can also specify a custom directory containing
    your entire music collection,  and this service will pick from those files to
    play.\r\n\r\n[h1]These are the confgurable settings.[/h1]\r\nAlarmClockBuzzerTime
    - The length of time to play the alarm clock for.  If the track/clip is shorter
    than this specififed time and it is not looped, it will play the entire clip,
    then shut off.  Otherwise, it will pick a random spot within that clip and play
    that length of time of the clip.   If you don't wish to load in your music collection,
    you can ignore the rest of the settings.\r\n\r\nSoundFileDirectory - Where you
    music collection resides.\r\n\r\nRescanDirectory - If set to true, your specified
    directory will be rescanned prior to the start of each bomb,  otherwise, it will
    only be scanned once.\r\n\r\nChanceOfNormalBeep - A number between 0 and 100,
    specifying the percert chance that the alarm clock will play the annoying beep
    instead of your loaded music.\r\n\r\n[h1]Supported File Formats[/h1]\r\nThese
    formats are supported.  \r\nStreaming formats: .MP3, .OGG, .WAV\r\nTracker formats:
    \ .IT, .S3M, .XM, .MOD\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]To Sound pack makers[/h1]\r\nWhether you
    are making a sound pack either the traditional way through Unity, or with Samfun's
    Sound Pack maker,  if you wish to have a particular Alarm clock beep file to loop,
    \ include \"[Looped]\" anywhere in the file name of that track.  If this mod finds
    that tag, it will Loop that clip.  (This also applies to anything that may be
    in your music collection.)\r\n"
