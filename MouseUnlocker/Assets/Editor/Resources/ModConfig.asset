  description: 'Has having to alt-tab out of the game in order to be able to do stuff
    on your secondary monitor gotton on your last nerve?  This mod makes it so you
    don''t have to use the alt-tab to break game focus, and allows you to freely move
    the mouse to focus a different app if desired.


    Note, as of Version 1.6.0 of the game, there is now a persistent setting inside
    of PlayerSettings.xml that this mod will set to false for you. This persistent
    setting is called LockMouseToWindow, and is true by default, and undocumented,
    with no in-game way to change it.


    Once you have run this mod once, you can freely disable this mod, and the unlocking
    will persist.'
